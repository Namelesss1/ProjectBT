### Mod Folder
This folder consists of the main PPC ASM code used to implement all new game functionality of this project. 
It is organized into different .mod files (e.g. Items.mod is where any code used for features relating to items go). 
Specific information related to each .mod file is commented within the files themselves.

Note that this code will not be released here yet until a public version of the project is released.
